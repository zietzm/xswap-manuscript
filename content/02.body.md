### XSwap algorithm

Hanhijärvi, et al. presented XSwap [@doi:10.1137/1.9781611972795.67], an algorithm for the randomization ("permutation") of unweighted networks (Figure {@fig:algo}A).
The algorithm picks two existing edges at random, and if the edges constitute a valid swap, exchanges the targets between the edges (Figure {@fig:xswap}).

The algorithm preserves both the source- and target-degree for all nodes.](images/xswap_figure.png){#fig:xswap width="50%"}

To allow greater flexibility, we modified the algorithm by adding two parameters, "`allow_self_loops`", and "`allow_antiparallel`" that allow a greater variety of network types to be permuted (Figure {@fig:algo}B).
Specifically, two chosen edges constitute a valid swap if they preserve degree for all four involved nodes and do not violate the above condition options.
The motivation for these generalizations is to make the permutation method applicable both to directed and undirected graphs, as well as to networks with different types of nodes, variously called multipartite, heterogeneous, or multimodal networks.
We provide documentation for parameter choices depending on the type of network being permuted in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/hetio/xswap).
The original algorithm and our proposed modification are given in Figure {@fig:algo}.

### Edge prior

We introduce the "edge prior" to quantify the probability that two nodes are connected based only on their degree.
The edge prior can be estimated using the maximum likelihood estimate for the binomial distribution success probability--the fraction of permuted networks in which a given edge exists.
Based only on permuted networks, the edge prior does not contain any information about the true edges in the (unpermuted) network.
The edge prior is a numerical feature that can be computed for each node pair in a network, and we compared its ability to predict edges in three tasks, discussed below.

### Edge prior approximation

We also considered the possibility that the probability of an edge existing across permuted networks could be written as a closed form equation involving the node pair's degree.
We were unable to find a closed-form solution giving the edge prior without assuming independent node pairs, which we believe is incorrect for XSwap.
Nonetheless, we discovered a good approximation to the edge prior for networks with many nodes and relatively low edge density.

Let $m$ be the total number of edge in the network, and $d(u_i)$, $d(v_j)$ be the source and target degrees of a node pair, respectively.
A good approximation of the edge prior is given by the following:
\begin{equation}
    P_{i,j} = \frac{d(u_i) d(v_j)}{\sqrt{(d(u_i) d(v_j))^2 + (m - d(u_i) - d(v_j) + 1)^2}}
\end{equation}

Further discussion of this approximate edge prior and an derivation are available in [the supplement](#approx-prior-supp).

In the third prediction task, we computed the three edge prediction features for paired networks representing data from PPI, TF-TG, and bioRxiv bioinformatics pre-print co-authorship.
The goal of the task was to compare predictive performance across different degree distributions for the same type of data.
We find that the task of predicting systematically-derived edges using a network with degree bias is significantly more challenging than network reconstruction, and we find consistently lower performance compared to the other tasks (Figure {@fig:discrimination}).
The edge prior was not able to predict the separate PPI network better than by random guessing (AUROC of roughly 0.5).
Only slightly better was its performance in predicting the separate TF-TG network, at an AUROC of 0.59.
We find superior performance in predicting the co-authorship relationships (AUROC 0.75), which was expected as the network being predicted shared roughly the same degree distribution as the network on which the edge prior was computed.
The results of the third prediction task show that a difference in degree distribution between the network on which features are computed and the network to be predicted can make prediction significantly more challenging.
